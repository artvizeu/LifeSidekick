# Wish'n'Fish
MobCon Hackathon 2015

Wish’n’Fish is an app that acts like a mediator between on the one hand a person who wants to get something, doesn’t have the necessary amount of money but has skills and on the other someone who can make use of the skills introduced by an app subscriber.

The app also serves as a money-box for those who have made a wish. The moment they manage to collect the entire amount for any of the wishes they have posted, the app sends the money to the online store where the item can be bought. Then the online store ships the item that the account holder wished for. Thus Wish’n’Fish makes sure the wish-makers do get what they wished for and don’t waste the money.

The app aims to integrate with numerous online stores where the wish-makers can order items from. But Wish’n’Fish can also turn into a powerful social network, where people’s needs and skills get to meet.
